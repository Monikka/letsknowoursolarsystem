This is Sankey chart with planets nodes in the left axis and the years since the first satelite was launched until today in the right axis.
The links connecting the nodes of the axes are the space missions carried out by NASA and other space agencies. This is a simple timeline
listing the launch year of the space crafts and their destinations for every mission (both failure and success) so far in history.
In the future, I plan to include another visual metric "weight" for the links that determine their width (strokewidth) based on the budgets of each mission.
